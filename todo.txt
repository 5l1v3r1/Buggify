***NEW FEATURES***

-Consider consolidating both py files into one file for easier use
-Alternatively pursue a GUI implementation / Pyinstaller
-Grammar mode
	-Allows for automatic inputting of Grammar, spelling and punctuation errors 
	 geared more towards education
-Programming Language specific bugs 
	-Possible abstraction of functions to be more customizable based on the language
	-Automatically detect language based on file extension


***ISSUES***
-Must test with various file types to anticipate encoding errors.
-Must test with various file types to anticipate errors with bugs not 
 able to be applied. For example, what if a text file doesn't contain triple quotes -
 ''' , how will it react?
-Functions are inconsistent regarding how many times they run 
	-Some functions exit without executing since they don't fulfill all conditionals
	-Some functions will not exit until it is executed at least once
	-Ideally, all functions should not exit without executing once
		-Consider a case where a function does not apply to any of the lines in the file
		-"bugged_docstring" would result in an infinite loop if 
		 there are no docstrings in the file
		-Thus for consistency, if a function CAN apply to a file, 
		 it should execute once before exiting	
-Some bugs are found when buggify is run 500 times or more. Indexes are out of range.		 
-Diff with more context so the line_switch function diff makes more sense
	-Tabling this for now as I tried it but it felt more confusing
-Documentation
	-Add additional comments
	-Rewrite DocStrings to be more descriptive
	-Consider writing a detailed guide for how this all works together

***BUG FUNCTION IDEAS***

-Insert charachter at random point in the line
	-Duplicate the charachter?
