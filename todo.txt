***NEW FEATURES***
-Grammar mode
	-Allows for automatic inputting of Grammar, spelling and punctuation errors 
	 geared more towards education

-Programming Language specific bugs 
	-Possible abstraction of functions to be more customizable based on the language
	-Automatically detect language based on file extension
		
***ISSUES***
-Must test with various file types to anticipate errors with bugs not 
 able to be applied. For example, what if a text file doesn't contain triple quotes -
 ''' , how will it react?
-Functions are inconsistent regarding how many times they run 
	-Some functions exit without executing since they don't fulfill all conditionals
	-Ideally, all functions should not exit without executing once
		-Consider a case where a function does not apply to any of the lines in the file
		-"bugged_docstring" would result in an infinite loop if 
		 there are no docstrings in the file
		-Thus for consistency, if a function CAN apply to a file, 
		 it should execute once before exiting	


Other random thoughts:


-- The Bugged docstring may have an error but i am not compleltely sure yet.
