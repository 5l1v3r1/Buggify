NEW FEATURES:
-The program's initialization should be done as a function, so you can simple type "buggify()"
-Allow for the input of declared files so the entire function can run on multiple files
	#For each file in this directory:
	#	buggify(each file)
-Consider consolidating both py files into one file for easier use
-Alternatively pursue a GUI implementation / Pyinstaller

-Grammar mode
	-Allows for automatic inputting of Grammar, spelling and punctuation errors geared more towards education
-Programming Language specific bugs 
	-Possible abstraction of functions to be more customizable based on the language
	-Automatically detect language based on file extension

ISSUES:
-Diff with more context so the line_switch function diff makes more sense
-Change variables to be more descriptive eg. "mylist"
-Add additional comments
-Functions are inconsistent regarding how many times they run 
	-Some functions exit without executing since they don't fulfill all conditionals
	-Some functions will not exit until it is executed at least once
	-Ideally, all functions should not exit without executing once
		-Consider a case where a function does not apply to any of the lines in the file
		-"bugged_docstring" would result in an infinite loop if there are no docstrings in the file
		-Thus for consistency, if a function CAN apply to a file, it should execute once before exiting	

BUG FUNCTION IDEAS:
-Use Regex to change snake_case to CamelCase
-Insert charachter at random point in the line
	-Duplicate the charachter?
